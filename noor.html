                Hello My Love💛
                <br/><br/>Thank you for making my life as beautiful as you are. You are my definition of love, and love is what's there when you are away from me. 
                Just in case you ever foolishly forget; I'm never not thinking of you. To be honest, I never thought someone would come into my life out of nowhere and become so important in such a short time.
                I’ve never had a moment’s doubt. I love you. I believe in you completely.
                <br/><br/>I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am to have you by my side. Your cute and beautiful self always brightens my day. You're seriously the prettiest girl ever, 
                even when you have your silly moments. It makes me smile and fall in love with you even more. You are my heart, my life, my one and only thought.
                (Ps. Do not stop me from slapping your butt. hehe)
